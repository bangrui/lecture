## How many are you?

In the first lecture, we ran a parallel protocol for counting attendance:

 - Rightmost person per row counts all in row
 - When done counting, raises hand
 - State number in row when called on

after which the instructor gets to gather and sum the row counts.

In practice, this took X time.  This includes

 - Time to start the process
 - Time to compute row counts
 - Time for the instructor to gather counts
 - Time for instructor to do the arithmetic

Consider the following questions:

To answer all the following questions, let's assume each operation takes c time, 
including but not limited to addition and counting. Further, let's assume there are 
N students in total sitting in k rows, with each row the same number of students, 
which is N/k.

1. What is a simple model that would predict this time?
	The simplest prediction will be:
	N * c / k + c * k
2. What about a simple model to predict time for one person to count?
	N * c
3. How big should the class be before the parallel method takes less time?
	For a fixed k,
	   N * c > N * c / k + c * k
<==>   N * c * (k-1) / k > c * k
<==>   N > k * k / (k - 1)
